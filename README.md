# Shrimple
Shrimple: a Python dictionary you can use to run your orthospelling theory

## What is orthospelling?
After defining your chords, Shrimple will make any combination valid

Even if you don't have "thou hath thee" in your dictionaries, you can Shrimple them in a single stroke, because the chords that make up the stroke are defined already.

```
Example Shrimple chords:
T → t
H → h
AOE → ee
O → o
*T → th
U → u
```
```
Example Shrimple ouputs
🦐THOU → thou
🦐HA\*T → hath
🦐THAOE → thee
```

But of course most chords are exactly what you expect, so you should be able to use Shrimple already!
```
🦐TKOG → dog
🦐STOEUPB → stoin
🦐STEPB/OG/RAP/H*D → stenography (I use *D → y)
```



This is about as Shromplicated as it gets: (If you chose to one-stroke it of course)

`🦐#SKHR*EUFRPLD → Shrimple`
Using the logic:
```
# → capitalisation (Lapwing theory)
SKHR → shr (Josiah theory)
FRPL → mple (Plover theory)
*D is for {^y} (Josiah theory)
```


## What's the 🦐?

It's whatever you use to enter Shrimple mode, by default it's the stroke "SHREUFRPL", but I use a dedicated + key to save me a stroke

## "I'm stuck in Shrimple"
Use any punctuation to exit, if I forgot to include whatever stroke you use for punctuation, you can add it to the exit strokes
Or if you use a dedicated key, you can make Shrimple always exit after just a single stroke
