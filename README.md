# Shrimple
Shrimple: a Python dictionary you can use to run your orthospelling theory

## What is orthospelling?
After defining your chords, Shrimple will make any combination valid

Even if you don't have "thou hath thee" in your dictionaries, you can Shrimple them in a single stroke, because the chords that make up the stroke are defined already.

TH ‚Üí th
O ‚Üí o
U ‚Üí u
Then ü¶êTHOU ‚Üí thou

H ‚Üí h
A ‚Üí a
\*T ‚Üí th
Then ü¶êHA\*T ‚Üí hath

TH ‚Üí th
AOE ‚Üí ee
Then ü¶êTHAOE ‚Üí thee

ü¶êTKOG -> dog
ü¶êSTOEUPB -> stoin
ü¶êSTEPB/OG/RAP/H*D -> stenography (I use *D -> y)


This is about as complex as it gets:
ü¶ê#SKHREUFRPLZ -> Shrimple
# is for capitalisation (Lapwing theory)
SKHR is for "shr" (Josiah theory)
FRPL is for "mpl" (Plover theory)
Z is for "e" (Shrimple theory)


What's the ü¶ê?
It's whatever you use to enter Shrimple mode, by default it's the stroke "SHREUFRPL", but I use a dedicated + key to save me a stroke

"I'm stuck in Shrimple"
Use any punctuation to exit, if I forgot to include whatever stroke you use for punctuation, you can add it to the exit strokes
Or if you use a dedicated key, you can make Shrimple always exit after just a single stroke
